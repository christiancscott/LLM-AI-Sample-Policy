# ü§ñ A Sample Company Policy For Large Language Model Artificial Intelligence (LLM AI)
This sample policy outlines guidelines for the responsible use of LLM AI solutions to ensure the confidentiality of company data, the security of systems, the privacy of customer data, and the accuracy of LLM AI responses.
### Author(s): Christian Scott

## ‚ú® The Objective of This Sample Policy
A year ago, most companies didn't have a policy on guiding staff on how to safely leverage large language artificial intelligence (LLM AI) but now with popular solutions like ChatGPT making the news on a daily basis, staff are utilizing LLM AI for daily tasks like writing code, creating reports and creating new content.

Without any guidance on how to safely utilize LLM AI like ChatGPT, staff at many companies are endangering the confidentiality of sensitive information, and the security of company systems and potentially violating many company policies and laws.

I felt there was a need to create a sample policy ([Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) that businesses could leverage as a starting point for dictating the ethical, lawful, and secure use of LLM AI technologies that abide by corporate policies.

## Corporate Policy On Utilizing Large Language Model Artificial Intelligence such as ChatGPT

**Policy Version & Revision:** 1.0

**Policy Author(s) & Maintainer(s):** <MAINTAINER>

**Policy Authorization Date:** <DATE>

## Purpose & Scope

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirements and guidelines for the use of LLM AI, such as ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, Notion, or similar solutions, by employees, contractors, temporaries, referred to as ‚Äústaff members‚Äù of our company, whether through company-owned devices or BYOD. This policy aims to ensure that the use of LLM AI is ethical, lawful, secure, and abides by all company policies, applicable laws, and regulations.

## Important Risks to Consider When Utilizing LLM AI

The use of LLM AI has inherent risks that staff members must be aware of and understand before using LLM AI.

1. **Data Confidentiality & Privacy Risks:**
    - Information entered into LLM AI may become public or utilized in a training dataset, which could result in the disclosure of sensitive company data. Such disclosures could violate data privacy laws, breach customer contracts, or compromise company trade secrets. The privacy policies of LLM AI solution providers vary and, in many instances, permit the LLM AI solution provider to train their language models on any questions, requests, or data submitted to the LLM AI solution provider.
2. **Accuracy & Quality Control Risks:**
    - LLM AI relies upon algorithms that are trained on limited datasets to generate content. There is a significant risk that LLM AI may generate inaccurate or unreliable, and completely false information, known as hallucinations. Staff members should exercise extreme caution when relying on LLM AI generated content and always review and edit responses for accuracy before utilizing any content.
3. **Intellectual Property Risks:**
    - To the extent that staff members utilize LLM AI to generate any content or code, that content may not be protected by copyright laws in many jurisdictions due to the fact there was no human authorship. As of March 2023, the United States Copyright Office does not recognize LLM AI generated content as copyrightable.
        - Source: [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/03/16/2023-05321/copyright-registration-guidance-works-containing-material-generated-by-artificial-intelligence)
    - Since LLM AI generated content is based on previous training datasets, the content may be considered a derivative work of any copyrighted materials used to train the LLM AI .
    - To the extent that code, financial data, other trade secrets, or confidential information are submitted to a public LLM AI for analysis, there is a risk that other users and companies that utilize that same LLM AI may be able to access and disclose that sensitive information.
    - Any software code submitted to or received from LLM AI, such as ChatGPT, may include some open-source derivative references, which may be subject to various open-source license obligations and requirements such as:
        - The redistribution of open-source code
        - Limitations on the commercial use of open-source code
        - Author attribution references the original author of the open-source code.
4. **Bias & Objectionable Content Risks:**
    - LLM AI may produce biased, discriminatory, offensive, or unethical content.
    - Furthermore, LLM AI may produce content that does not align with the company‚Äôs mission, vision, values, and policies.
5. **Data Security Risks:**
    - LLM AI may store and process sensitive data, which could be at risk of being accessed by unauthorized parties, unintentionally leaked, breached, or hacked through various means, such as prompt injection attacks.
